(a script I actually use when I need to explain this stuff to normal humans)

Hey, it’s me again.

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve sat in a meeting showing a manager a scatter plot full of “Cluster 0”, “Cluster 1”, “Cluster 2”… and watched their soul quietly leave their body.

So one rainy afternoon I got fed up and wrote this instead.

This script doesn’t treat your customers like points on a graph.  
It treats them like actual people who walk into your shop, argue about what to buy, and sometimes impulse-purchase a candle because it smells nice.

### What you’ll see when you run it
- It says hello like a human  
- It tells you how many ladies vs gents you have (turns out it’s usually more ladies)  
- It gently figures out the natural “types” of shopper  
- It gives each type a name I’d actually say out loud without dying inside  
- It draws the prettiest plots you’ve ever seen from this dataset  
- At the end it lets you type in a real person (“my sister, 28, earns 70k, spends like crazy”) and it instantly tells you which group she belongs to  

### The five types it almost always finds
(Names I came up with while drinking tea and staring at the scatter plot for the 47th time)

- Careful Earners – good salary, thinks twice before buying anything  
- Young & Fun – broke-ish but will still buy the cool hoodie  
- Big Spenders – walks in, buys the expensive bag, thanks you, leaves  
- Sensible Savers – compares prices on their phone while standing in your store  
- Comfortable Middle – happily buys two of everything on sale  

### How to run it (takes 10 seconds)
1. Grab Mall_Customers.csv from Kaggle (literally just Google it)  
2. Throw the CSV in the same folder as this python file  
3. Run it:
